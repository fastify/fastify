#### Are you sure this is an issue with the fastify or are you just looking for some help?

Issues should only be posted in this repository after you have been able to reproduce
them and confirm that they are a bug or incorrect/missing information in the [docs](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/docs).

For all other questions, requests, help resolving an issue, or if you are not sure if this is
the right place, please do not open an issue here. Instead, ask a question in our [help](https://github.com/fastify/help) repository or try to find a solution in the community [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/fastify).

If you have issues with the [fastify.io](https://www.fastify.io) site, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/fastify/website/issues).

are reported privately so we have time to address them before they become public knowledge. Please
email all security related issues to the [Fastify Team](https://github.com/fastify/fastify#team).
