# Code of Conduct

Fastify, as member project of the OpenJS Foundation, use [Contributor Covenant v1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) as their code of conduct. The full text is included [below](#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) in English, and translations are available from the Contributor Covenant organisation:

- [contributor-covenant.org/translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)
- [github.com/ContributorCovenant](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant/tree/release/content/version/1/4)

Refer to the sections on reporting and escalation in this document for the specific emails that can be used to report and escalate issues.

## Reporting

### Project Spaces

For reporting issues in spaces related to Fastify please use the email `hello@matteocollina.com` or `tommydelved@gmail.com`. Fastify handles CoC issues related to the spaces that it maintains. Projects maintainers commit to:

- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

### Foundation Spaces

For reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email `report@lists.openjsf.org`. The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports and commits to:

- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

## Escalation

The OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP). This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to `coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org`.

For more information, refer to the full [Code of Conduct governance document](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at the email addresses listed above in
the [Reporting](#reporting) and [Escalation](#escalation) sections. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
