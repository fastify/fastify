# Documentation Link Checker Report

This report was generated by `check-links.js` on January 22, 2026.

## Summary

- **Total files checked:** 42 markdown files
- **Total links found:** 1,170 links
- **Broken links found:** 38 links

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Fixed Internal Links (2)

**File:** `docs/Reference/Decorators.md`
- **Issue:** Used absolute paths `/docs/Reference/TypeScript.md` instead of relative paths
- **Fix:** Changed to `./TypeScript.md` (relative path)
- **Lines:** 403, 433

### Potential Issues Requiring Review

#### False Positives (1)

**File:** `docs/Guides/Style-Guide.md:67`
- **Link:** `www.websitename.com`
- **Status:** This is an example placeholder in documentation showing markdown syntax, not a real link
- **Action:** No fix needed

#### External Links Requiring Manual Review (32)

Many npmjs.com links returned errors during automated checking. This may be due to:
1. npmjs.com blocking HEAD requests from automated tools
2. Rate limiting
3. Genuine broken links

**Affected packages:**
- migrate-mongo, postgrator, accepts, mqtt, node-polyglot
- qs, undici, supertest, abstract-logging, encodeurl
- fast-json-stringify, @fastify/proxy-addr, avvio
- @sinclair/typebox, json-schema-to-ts, depcheck, npm-check, ajv

**Recommendation:** Manual verification needed for these links. Consider:
- Using GET requests instead of HEAD for npm links
- Adding retry logic with exponential backoff
- Whitelisting known-good domains like npmjs.com

#### External Links to Verify (4)

These external links should be manually verified:
1. Google Cloud blog post (Kubernetes health checks)
2. Vercel templates and documentation
3. Medium articles
4. Web Archive link

## Link Checker Tool

The `check-links.js` script has been added to automate link validation. 

### Usage

```bash
node check-links.js
```

### Features

- Recursively scans all markdown files in `/docs`
- Validates both internal and external links
- Reports broken links with file location and line numbers
- Batch processing for external links to avoid rate limiting

### Future Improvements

1. Skip code blocks and example placeholders
2. Use GET instead of HEAD for npmjs.com
3. Add retry logic for transient failures
4. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
5. Create allowlist for known-good domains
6. Add configuration file for custom settings

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix internal link paths in Decorators.md
2. ⏳ Manual verification of external links
3. ⏳ Consider adding link checker to CI workflow
4. ⏳ Update script with improvements listed above
