# Fastify Charter

The Fastify project aims to build a fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js.


## Section 0: Guiding Principles

The Fastify project is part of the [OpenJS Foundation][openjs foundation]. It operates transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.


## Section 1: Scope

Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a plugin architecture.

### 1.1: In-scope

+ Develop a web framework for Node.js with a focus on developer experience, performance and extensibility.
+ Plugin Architecture
+ Support web protocols
+ Official plugins for common user requirements
+ Documentation:
  + Project (policies, processes, and releases)
  + Guides and Tutorials
  + Framework API
  + Website
+ Write easier APIs for developers
+ Tools:
  + CI services
  + Bots to improve overall efficiency
  + Releases
+ Support:
  + Community
  + Users's issues and questions
+ Contributors's pull request review

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope

+ Support versions of Node.js at EOL (end of life) stage
+ Support serverless architecture
+ Contributions that violates the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)


## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.

Technical leadership for the projects within the [OpenJS Foundation][openjs foundation] is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) (CPC). In the case of the Fastify project, it is delegated to the [Fastify Collaborators](README.md#team). The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the "Board").

This Fastify Charter reflects a carefully constructed balanced role for the Collaborators and the CPC in the governance of the OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the Fastify Collaborators to propose change using simple majority of the full Fastify Organization, the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the CPC. The CPC may additionally make amendments to the Collaborators charter at any time, though the CPC will not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings of the Fastify Organization.


### 2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships

### Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections

**Decision-making**

Fastify's features can be discussed in GitHub issues and/or projects.
Consensus on a discussion is reached when there is no objection by any
collaborators.

Whenever there is not consensus, Lead Maintainers will have final say on the topic.

**Voting, and/or Elections**

These processes are described in the [GOVERNANCE](GOVERNANCE.md) document.

## Section 5: Definitions

+ *Contributors*: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the projectâ€™s Collaborators to have code committed to the code base. Contributors should rarely be encumbered by the Fastify Collaborators and never by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.

+ *Collaborators*: contribute code and other artifacts, have the right to commit to the code base and release plugins projects. Collaborators follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to manage the project. A Collaborator could be encumbered by other Fastify Collaborators and never by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.

+ *Lead Maintainers*: founders of the project, contribute code and other artifacts, have the right to commit to the code base and release the project. Lead Maintainers follow the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to manage the project. A Lead Maintainer will be encumbered by the Fastify Collaborators and by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.
