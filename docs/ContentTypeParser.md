# Content Type Parser
Natively Fastify supports only `application/json` content-type. If you need to support different content types you can use the `addContentTypeParser` api.  
*Note that you can't add a custom content type parser for `application/json` because Fastify has a fast case for it.*

As the others api, `addContentTypeParser` is encapsulated in the scope where you are declaring it, this means that if you declare it in the root scope it will be available every where, while if you declare it inside a register it will be available only in the scope and its sons.

## Usage
```js
fastify.addContentTypeParser('application/jsoff', function (req, done) {
  jsoffParser(req, function (err, body) {
    done(err || body)
  })
})
```

You can also use the api `hasContentTypeParser` to find if a specific content-type parser already exist.
