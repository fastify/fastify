## Types Of Contributions We're Looking For
<a id="contribution-types"></a>

In short, we welcome any type of contribution you are willing to provide. No
contribution is too small. We gladly accept contributions such as:

* Documentation improvements: from small typo corrections to major document
  reworks
* Helping others by answering questions in pull requests and
  [discussions](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/discussions)
* Fixing [known
  bugs](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
* Reporting previously unknown bugs by opening an issue with a minimal
  reproduction

## Ground Rules & Expectations
<a id="contributing-rules"></a>

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you
should expect from others):

* Be respectful and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. This
  project is maintained by a diverse set of people from all across the globe.
  Each person has their own views and opinions about the project. Try to listen
  to each other and reach an agreement or compromise.
* We have a [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You
  must adhere to it to participate in this project.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all
  tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can
  merge your contribution.

## How To Contribute
<a id="contributing-how-to"></a>

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the
[issues](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues) and [pull
requests](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pulls) to see whether someone else
has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this
guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new feature, start by opening an
  issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
  do any work.

## Setting Up Your Environment
<a id="contributing-environment"></a>

Please adhere to the project's code and documentation style. Some popular tools
that automatically "correct" code and documentation do not follow a style that
conforms to the styles this project uses. Notably, this project uses
[StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) for code formatting.

### Using Visual Studio Code
<a id="contributing-vscode"></a>

What follows is how to use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
portable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable) to create a
Fastify specific environment. This guide is written as if you are setting up the
environment on macOS, but the principles are the same across all platforms. See
the previously linked VSCode portable guide for help with other platforms.

First, [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and unpackage
it to `/Applications/VSCodeFastify/`. Upon doing so, the following should output
"found" when run in a terminal:

```sh
[ -d /Applications/VSCodeFastify/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app ] && echo "found"
```

As mentioned in the VSCode portable guide, we need to unsandbox the application
for the portable mode to work correctly. So issue the following in a terminal:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VSCodeFastify/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app
```

Next, create the required data directories for VSCode:

```sh
mkdir -p /Applications/VSCodeFastify/code-portable-data/{user-data,extensions}
```

Before continuing, we need to add the `code` command to your terminal's `PATH`.
To do so, we will [manually add VSCode to the
`PATH`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
As outlined in that document, the instructions vary depending on your default
shell, so you should follow the instructions in that guide as relates to your
preferred shell. However, we will tweak them slightly by defining an alias
instead of a direct reference to the `code` tool. This is so we do not conflict
with any other installation of VSCode you may have, and to keep this guide
specific to Fastify. So, ultimately, we want the following:

```sh
alias code-fastify="/Applications/VSCodeFastify/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code"
```

The result should be that `code-fastify --version` results in something like:

```sh
❯ code-fastify --version
1.50.0
93c2f0fbf16c5a4b10e4d5f89737d9c2c25488a3
x64
```

Now that VSCode is installed, and we can work with it via the command line, we
need to install an extension that will aid in keeping any JavaScript you write
for the project formatted according to the project's style:

```sh
code-fastify --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

Upon successful execution of the previous command, the following command should
result in "found" being output:

```sh
[ -d /Applications/VSCodeFastify/code-portable-data/extensions/dbaeumer.vscode-eslint-* ] && echo "found"
```

Now, from within the directory of your local clone of the Fastify project, we
can open VSCode:

```sh
code-fastify .
```

A new VSCode window should open and you should see the Fastify project files in
the left sidebar. But wait! We are not quite done yet. There are a few more
baseline settings that should be set before VSCode is ready.

Press `cmd+shift+p` to bring up the VSCode command input prompt. Type `open
settings (json)` and then choose the same item from the filtered menu. This will
open a document that is the settings for the editor. Paste the following JSON
into this document, overwriting any text already present, and save it:

```json
{
    "[javascript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll": true
        }
    },

    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "statusBar.background": "#178bb9"
    }
}
```

Finally, from the menu bar, select "Terminal > New Terminal" to open a new terminal
in the editor. Run `npm i` to install the Fastify dependencies.

At this point, you are all setup with a custom VSCode instance that can be used
to work on Fastify contributions. As you edit and save JavaScript files, the
editor will autocorrect any style issues.
