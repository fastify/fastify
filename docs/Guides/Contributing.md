## Types Of Contributions We're Looking For
<a id="contribution-types"></a>

In short, we welcome any type of contribution you are willing to provide. No
contribution is too small. We gladly accept contributions such as:

* Documentation improvements: from small typo corrections to major document
  reworks
* Helping others by answering questions in pull requests and
  [discussions](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/discussions)
* Fixing [known
  bugs](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
* Reporting previously unknown bugs by opening an issue with a minimal
  reproduction

## Ground Rules & Expectations
<a id="contributing-rules"></a>

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you
should expect from others):

* Be respectful and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. This
  project is maintained by a diverse set of people from all across the globe.
  Each person has their own views and opinions about the project. Try to listen
  to each other and reach an agreement or compromise.
* We have a [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You
  must adhere to it to participate in this project.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all
  tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can
  merge your contribution.

## How To Contribute
<a id="contributing-how-to"></a>

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the
[issues](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues) and [pull
requests](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pulls) to see whether someone else
has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this
guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new feature, start by opening an
  issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
  do any work.

## Setting Up Your Environment
<a id="contributing-environment"></a>

Please adhere to the project's code and documentation style. Some popular tools
that automatically "correct" code and documentation do not follow a style that
conforms to the styles this project uses. Notably, this project uses
[Neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard) for code formatting.
