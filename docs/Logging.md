# Logging

Since Fastify is really focused on performances, we choose the best logger to achieve the goal. **[Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)**!

By default Fastify uses [pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http) as the logger, with the log level set to `'fatal'`.

If you want to pass some options to the logger, just pass the logger option to Fastify.
You can find all the options in the [Pino documentation](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/API.md#pinooptions-stream). If you want to pass a custom stream to the Pino instance, just add the stream field to the logger object.
```js
const split = require('split2')
const stream = split(JSON.parse)

const fastify = require('fastify')({
  logger: {
    level: 'info',
    stream: stream
  }
})

fastify.get('/', options, function (req, reply) {
  req.log.info('Some info about the current request')
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})
```

You can also supply your own logger instance. Instead of passing configuration options, simply pass the instance.
The logger you supply must conform to the Pino interface; that is, it must have the following methods:
`info`, `error`, `debug`, `fatal`, `warn`, `trace`, `child`.

Example:

```js
const log = require('pino')({ level: 'info' })
const fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: log })

log.info('does not have request information')

fastify.get('/', function (req, reply) {
  req.log.info('includes request information, but is the same logger instance as `log`')
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})
```

*The logger instance for the current request is available in every part of the [lifecycle](docs/Lifecycle.md).*
