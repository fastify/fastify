# Plugins
Fastify allows the user to extend its functionalities with plugins.
A plugin can be a set of routes, a server [decorator](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Decorators.md) or whatever. The API that you will need to use one or more plugins, is `register`.  

By default, `register` creates a *new scope*, this means that if you do some changes to the Fastify instance (via `decorate`), this change will not be reflected to the current context ancestors, but only to its sons. This feature allows us to achieve plugin *encapsulation* and *inheritance*, in this way we create a *direct acyclic graph* (DAG) and we will not have issues caused by cross dependencies.

You already see in the [getting started](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md#register) section how use this API, is pretty straightforward.
```
fastify.register(plugin, [options], [callback])
```
Example:
```js
fastify.register([
  require('./another-route'),
  require('./yet-another-route')
], opts, function (err) {
  if (err) throw err
})
```

#### Route Prefixing option
If you pass an option with the key `prefix` with a `string` value, Fastify will use it to prefix all the routes inside the register, for more info check [here](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Routes.md#route-prefixing).

<a name="error-handling"></a>
#### Error handling
The error handling is done by [avvio](https://github.com/mcollina/avvio#error-handling).  
As general rule is highly recommended that you handle your errors in the `register`'s callback, otherwise the server will not start, and you will find the unhandled error in the `listen` callback.

<a name="create-plugin"></a>
## Create a plugin
Create a plugin is very easy, you just need to create a function that takes three parameters, the `fastify` instance, an options object and the next callback.  
Example:
```js
module.exports = function (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.decorate('utility', () => {})

  fastify.get('/', handler)

  next()
}
```
You can also use `register` inside another `register`:
```js
module.exports = function (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.decorate('utility', () => {})

  fastify.get('/', handler)

  fastify.register(require('./other-plugin'))

  next()
}
```
Sometimes, you will need to know when the server is about to close, for example because you must close a connection to a database. To know when this is gonna happen, you can use the [`'onClose'`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Hooks.md#on-close) hook.

Do not forget that `register` will always create a new Fastify scope, if you don't need that, read the following section.

<a name="handle-scope"></a>
## Handle the scope
If you are using `register` only for extend a functionality of the server with  [`decorate`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Decorators.md), it is your responsibility tell Fastify to do not create a new scope, otherwise your changes will not be accessible by the user in the upper scope.

You have two ways to tell Fastify to avoid the creation of a new context:
- Use the [`fastify-plugin`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-plugin) module
- Use the `'skip-override'` hidden property

We recommend to use the `fastify-plugin` module, because it solves this problem for you, and you can pass as parameter a version range of Fastify that your plugin support.
```js
const fp = require('fastify-plugin')

module.exports = fp(function (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.decorate('utility', () => {})
  next()
}, '0.x')
```
Check the [`fastify-plugin`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-plugin) documentation to know more about how use this module.

If you won't use the `fastify-plugin` module, you can use the `'skip-override'` hidden property, but we do not recommend it, because if in the future the Fastify API will change, it will be a your responsibility update the module, while if you use `fastify-plugin`, you can be sure about back compatibility.
```js
function yourPlugin (fastify, opts, next) {
  fastify.decorate('utility', () => {})
  next()
}
yourPlugin[Symbol.for('skip-override')] = true
module.exports = yourPlugin
```
