# Fastify Style Guide


## Welcome

Welcome to *Fastify Style Guide*. This guide is here to provide you with a conventional writing style for users writing developer documentation for our Open Source framework. Each topic is precise and well explained to help you write documentation users can easily understand and implement.


<br>
<br>

## Who is this guide for?

## Before you write

You need to know the following:

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Git
* Github
* Markdown
* HTTP
* NPM 

<br>

### Consider your Audience

<br>

Before you start writing, think about who your audience. In this case, know HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NPM, and NodeJs. It is important to put them in mind because they are the one consuming your content. You want to give them as much useful information as possible. Consider the necessary things they to know and how they can get them, make references and use words they can easily relate. As for feedback from the community, it can help you write better documentation that focuses on the user and what you want to achieve.

<br>

### Get straight to the point

<br>

Give your readers a clear and precise action to take. Start with what is most important for your readers. This way, you can help them find what they need faster. Mostly, readers tend to read the first content on a page, and many will not scroll further.

**Example**

Less like this: Colons are very important to register a parametric path. It lets the framework know a there is a new parameter created. You can place the colon before the parameter name for the parametric path can be created.

More Like this: To register a parametric path, put a colon before the parameter name. Using colon lets the framework know it is a parametric path and not a wild card.



<br>

### Avoid adding video or image content 

<br>

Do not add videos or screenshots. Instead, make a referral link or a youtube video. You can add links by using `[Title](www.websitename.com)` in the markdown.

**Example**

> ```md
> To learn more about hooks, See [Fastify hooks](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Hooks).
> ```

Result: To learn more about hooks, See [Fastify hooks](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Hooks/).


<br>

### Avoid plagiarism

<br>

Make sure you evade copying other people's work, keep it as original as possible. You can learn from what they've done and also reference where it is if you used a particular quote from their work.

<br>

<br>

## Word Choice

<br>

<!-- content here -->

There are a few things you need to use and avoid when writing your documentation which will improve readability to your reader and also make your documentation neat, direct and clean all through your writing process.


<br>

### Use "you" instead of we or them


<br>

<!-- content here -->

Using the word "you" makes the reader know you are speaking to them. It is easier to give them direct instruction on what to do when a particular topic. 

 > According to [Wikipedia](#), ***You*** is usually a second person pronoun. Also, used to refer to an indeterminate person, as a more common alternative to a very formal indefinite pronoun.

<br>


### Avoid words like "*just*" or  "*simple*"


<br>

<!-- content here -->

The reader may not find it easy to use the Fastify's framework and plugins, so avoid words that make it sound like they are simple or easy. Not everyone who reads the documentation has the same level of understanding.

<br>

### Starting with a verb

<br>
<!-- content here -->

Mostly start your description with a verb, which makes it simple and precise for the reader to follow. Use present tense in more often as it is easier to read and understand than the past or future tense.

**Example**

- [ ] Less like this: There is a need for Nodejs to be installed before you can be able to use fastify.

- [x] More like this: Install Nodejs to make use of fastify.

<br>

### Grammatical moods 

<br>

<!-- content here -->

Grammatical moods is a great way to express your writing, don't want to sound too bossy while making a direct statement. Know when to switch between indicative, imperative, and Subjunctive moods.

<br>

**Indicative** - Use when making a factual statement or question. 

Example: Since there is no testing framework available, "fastify recommend ways to write your test".


<br>

**Imperative** - Use when giving instructions, actions, commands, or when you write your headings.

Example: Install dependencies before you start application development mode.

<br>

**Subjunctive** -  Use when making suggestions, hypothesis or non-factual statement.

Example: Reading the documentation on our website is recommended to get comprehensive knowledge on the framework plugin.


<br>

### Use **active** voice instead of **passive**
