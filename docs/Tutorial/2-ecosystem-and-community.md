# Fastify ecosystem and community

Before diving into code, it's worth understanding the people, values, 
and structure behind the project. 
Like any open source effort, the strength of Fastify lies not just in its 
technical design, but in the maintainers, contributors, and ecosystem that 
support it. 

### Active maintainers
The team is highly responsive. They regularly review issues and pull requests, 
and aim to provide fair and constructive feedback. The goal is to maintain a 
high-quality codebase without compromising performance or developer
experience.

### Notable contributors
Fastify benefits from contributors who are deeply involved in the Node.js 
ecosystem at large. Some are active in the development of the Node.js runtime 
itself, others maintain widely-used libraries and tools. 
Their experience helps to produce and maintain high-performance, secure code.

### Philosophy
The project is developed and maintained by a community of volunteers. 
User participation is not only welcome - it is encouraged. While maintainers 
tend to focus on issues that directly affect them, contributions that improve 
the framework and its ecosystem are genuinely valued.

### Part of the OpenJS Foundation
Fastify is an incubating project under the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/). 
This affiliation provides long-term structural support and ensures the 
project operates with transparent governance and community-first principles.
