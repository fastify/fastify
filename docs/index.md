The documentation for Fastify is split into two categories:

+ [Reference documentation][Reference]
+ [Guides][Guides]

The reference documenation utilizes a very formal style in an effort to document
Fastify's API and implementation details thoroughly for the developer who
needs such. The guides category utilizes an informal, educational, style as
a means to introduce newcomers to core, and advanced, Fastify concepts.

[Reference]: ./Reference/index.md
[Guides]: ./Guides/index.md

[reference documentation][Reference] directly to find the topic they are
seeking more information about.
