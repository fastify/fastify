<h1 align="center">Fastify</h1>

The documentation for Fastify is split into two categories:

- [Reference documentation](./Reference/index.md)
- [Guides](./Guides/index.md)

The reference documenation utilizes a very formal style in an effort to document
Fastify's API and implementation details thoroughly for the developer who
needs such. The guides category utilizes an informal, educational, style as
a means to introduce newcomers to core, and advanced, Fastify concepts.

## Where To Start

Complete newcomers to Fastify should first read our [Getting Started][gs]
guide.

Developers experienced with Fastify should consult the
[reference documentation][Reference] directly to find the topic they are
seeking more information about.
