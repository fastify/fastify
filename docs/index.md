<h1 align="center">Fastify</h1>

The documentation for Fastify is split into two categories:

- [Reference documentation](./Reference/Index.md)
- [Guides](./Guides/Index.md)

The reference documentation utilizes a very formal style in an effort to document
Fastify's API and implementation details thoroughly for the developer who needs
such. The guides category utilizes an informal educational style as a means to
introduce newcomers to core and advanced Fastify concepts.

## Where To Start

Complete newcomers to Fastify should first read our [Getting
Started](./Guides/Getting-Started.md) guide.

Developers experienced with Fastify should consult the [reference
documentation](./Reference/Index.md) directly to find the topic they are seeking
more information about.
